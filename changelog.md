## c-ares version 1.25.0 - Jan 3 2024

Changes:

## c-ares version 1.16.1 - May 11 2020

Security:

* Prevent possible use-after-free and double-free in ares\_getaddrinfo() if ares\_destroy() is called prior to ares\_getaddrinfo() completing. Reported by Jann Horn at Google Project Zero.

Changes:

Changes:

* CMake: Rework library function checking to prevent unintended linking with system libraries that aren't needed.
* Due to use of inet\_addr() it was not possible to return 255.255.255.255 from ares\_gethostbyname().
